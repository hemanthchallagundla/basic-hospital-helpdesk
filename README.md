Our project which is “Ayuda Hospital Help Desk”, our main motive 
is to avoid quandary and help patients and the company with mess-free 
business. 
In this project, we are going to create a user interface, which will be a 
one-way window to show the user services provided by the hospital. Here 
the user will find 3 categories:  
                                   1. Appointment with the doctor 
                                   2. Safety Precautions. 
                                   3. Laboratory tests. 
In the first category, the user will be able to find the details of the 
particular doctor he/she wants to consult. He/she can also check the 
availability of that doctor and also know the fee to be paid. 
           In the second category, the user can see all the guidelines for the first 
aid to be taken while in an emergency. For example, what to do when a 
person is having skin burns; steps to be followed for CPR; things you can 
do when you are having a cut. These all will be mentioned under this 
category.               
            In the third category, the user can access the information on all the 
lab tests available in the hospital such as screening tests, infectious disease 
tests, etc. Also, the price would be available for the respective test done, for 
what the user would like to choose. 
            These all are the help desk service we would like to provide the user 
with. This window is helpful for the user to check appointments, take 
medical checkups, or be aware of some basic and beneficial first aid 
information. 
             This window is easily accessible by anyone. It is difficult in this 
busy schedule to make time for a person to go to the hospital and have 
checkups. So, through this window, it will be simple to check the timings 
and fix the appointments according to their schedule. Saving a lot of time 
for the user.
